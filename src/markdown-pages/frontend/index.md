Although frontend is not my specialty, I still enjoy coding on it. The technologies that I dominate the most are HTML, CSS, SASS, ReactJS, and also flutter for mobile development.
Some projects that I have built and contributed on:

- [This one](https://github.com/lucascz37/portfolio)
- [Desafio Loopis](https://github.com/lucascz37/Desafio-Loopis)
- [CÃ¢mara dos Deputados](https://github.com/lucascz37/CamaraDosDeputados)
- [SpaceX-Wiki](https://github.com/lucascz37/SpaceX-Wiki)

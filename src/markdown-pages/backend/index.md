The backend is my favorite part of an application. I know about java, python, and also nodeJS(with/without typescript).
With python, I'm used to work with fastApi, and a bit of Django, while in java I have experience with spring boot, in nodeJS with express, and serverless. I forgot to mention Rust which is a language that I hope to use in a near future.
Some projects that I have built and contributed on:

- [Serverless Challenge](https://github.com/lucascz37/serverless-challenge)
- [Library Fafic](https://github.com/lucascz37/libraryFafic)
- [Rustlings exercises](https://github.com/lucascz37/rustlings_exercises)
- [DuckMapper](https://github.com/lucascz37/DuckMapper)
- [Track sales](https://github.com/lucascz37/track-sales/issues)
